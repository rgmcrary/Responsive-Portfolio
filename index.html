                <p class="bio-text">I have always been too analytic for my own good, so naturally, coding seemed to be a great fit. I enjoy creating
                    and disassembling things to see how they "work" and I think this is a perfect avenue to explore and take
                    advantage of this natural tendency.</p>
                <p class="bio-text">My hobbies include cooking, music (both recorded and live), video games and traveling. I have studied the
                    Korean language and enjoy cooking Korean cuisine as well as any cuisine. I like to look at menus and
                    recreate what I ordered at home. My music taste ranges greatly and I listen to music every chance I can
                    get as well as go to concerts, both locally and around the country. I currently have over 200 video games
                    and growing, although my time doesn't seem to be growing with the collection size.
